# My Course Web Site

Welcome to Stat 101, the imaginary course used for the example web site. In reality, you'll edit this file to give a more appropriate title and to say something about your own course and to create links to the data files you want to provide to your students.

For directions on how to do everything, go to <http://github.com/dtkaplan/stat101>.

## Week 1

Maybe you want to do a week-by-week format. Maybe day-by-day. It's up to you.

Data files for this week:

- `https://dtkaplan.github.io/stat101/test.csv`

To create the data table in your R session, copy and paste this command into your console:

```r
My_data <- read.csv("https://dtkaplan.github.io/stat101/test.csv")
```
